# student_generator
Generates as many fake students as you want and puts them in a json file. Student objects include, full name, id, and course selection

This is part of a partially failed project that attempted to automate the process of sorting students at the start of the school year.
The project is being labeled as a failure becuase there were simply to many variables to consider in the program and it ended up falling short. It's source code is now being recycled in other python projects that I am working on as of today.
